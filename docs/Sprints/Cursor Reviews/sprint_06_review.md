# Sprint 06 – Cursor PM+QA Review

## Progress & Status
Sprint-06 was re-scoped to build criteria-aware URL filters, but engineering work has **not** started; no PR exists.  PM assets shipped: updated `sprint_06_plan.md` and editable `search_criteria.yaml` (max_rent 2400, min_beds 1).  Sprint remains **open**.

## Green Badges & Metrics
`main` CI is still green; no code touched.  LOC delta from docs only: +12.

## Demo-able Capability
End-user can edit `search_criteria.yaml`, but runtime code ignores it until Sprint-06 implementation lands.

## Blockers / Costs / Risks
• Potential drift: criteria YAML merged before supporting code—risk of confusion.  
• No engineering branch yet; schedule slip if not started soon.

## Failing CI Steps
N/A – no runs triggered.

## TODOs Merged
`search_criteria.yaml` added, default values set (2400, 1-bed).

## Decisions Needed
• Approve shifting scheduler/dedup work to Sprint-07; re-confirm LOC budget (≤120).
