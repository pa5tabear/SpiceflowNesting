# Sprint 07 – Cursor PM+QA Review

## Progress & Status
Sprint-07 aimed to operationalise duplicate-safe scheduling and a manual CLI trigger. Merge PR `codex/implement-duplicate-safe-bot-scheduling` delivered:
• `scheduler.py` now schedules jobs every `RUN_INTERVAL_HOURS` (default 6 h).  
• New SQLAlchemy model `Run` and Alembic migration `versions/0002_run_table.py`; each job inserts a log row.  
• CLI command `poetry run rentbot run-once` triggers a full scrape-score cycle and exits 0.  
• Duplicate protection validated: two back-to-back runs add zero duplicate rows (`UniqueConstraint` hit <1 %).  All goals met ✅.

## Green Badges & Metrics
CI run #15634799012: **✔︎ success**.  
Coverage overall 85 % (unchanged).  
LOC delta +98 (below 120 budget).

## Demo-able Capability
`systemctl start rentbot` (or Docker) now scrapes every 6 h; `journalctl -u rentbot` shows Run IDs.  Running `poetry run rentbot run-once` manually logs Run-ID and exits.

## Blockers / Costs / Risks
• Run log table currently grows unbounded; consider TTL or nightly prune later.  
• Duplicate check relies on DB unique index; heavy load could still trigger IntegrityError exceptions—handled but logged.

## Failing CI Steps
N/A – all steps passed.

## TODOs Merged
No `TODO` markers introduced.

## Decisions Needed
• Approve Sprint-08 scope: scoring algorithm v1 (price, distance, amenities, sentiment) and keep LOC ≤120.
