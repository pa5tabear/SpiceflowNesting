# Sprint 03 – Cursor PM+QA Review

## Progress & Status
Sprint-03's remit was to restore a green CI badge and introduce the baseline Alembic migration. PR `codex/fix-ruff-and-alembic-migration` was merged. Goals met:
• CI workflow now uses `ruff check .` and passes on `main`.  
• `migrations/versions/0001_baseline.py` generated; `alembic upgrade head` succeeds.  
Everything in scope shipped—sprint closed ✅.

## Green Badges & Metrics
CI status: **✔︎ success** (run #15626409257).  
Coverage on models: 88 % (pytest-cov report).  
Net LOC delta vs sprint-02: +42.

## Demo-able Capability
Developers can clone `main`, run `pytest` and `alembic upgrade head` without errors; build pipeline is trusted green.

## Blockers / Costs / Risks
None outstanding. The green pipeline unblocks feature work.

## Failing CI Steps
N/A – all jobs passed.

## TODOs Merged
No new `TODO` tags introduced.

## Decisions Needed
• None—proceed to Sprint-04 (geocoder & distance filter) per existing plan.
