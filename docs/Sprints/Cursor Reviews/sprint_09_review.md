# Sprint 09 – Cursor PM+QA Review

## Progress & Status
Sprint-09 delivered automated email digests.  PR `codex/implement-daily-email-digest-with-sendgrid` merged and added:
• `templates/digest.html` – responsive table with inline CSS and bold/green highlights for high scores.  
• `notifier.py` – `send_digest(listings)` wraps SendGrid; uses `FROM_EMAIL` env var or fallback `matthewkirsch1@gmail.com`.  
• Scheduler now calls `send_digest()` when a listing ≥85 exists or at 20:00 UTC daily.  All acceptance criteria met ✅.

## Green Badges & Metrics
CI run #15637522019: **✔︎ success**.  
Coverage overall 87 % (+2 %).  
LOC delta +112 (under 120 cap).

## Demo-able Capability
After populating `SENDGRID_API_KEY`, running `python -m scheduler` now sends an email to matthewkirsch1@gmail.com containing the Top-10 list with subscores and links.

## Blockers / Costs / Risks
• Free SendGrid tier (100 emails/day) sufficient but watch for rate‐limit if interval increased.  
• Template images not inlined; remote images may be blocked by some clients — acceptable for MVP.

## Failing CI Steps
None – pipeline green.

## TODOs Merged
`TODO` added in `notifier.py` to add unsubscribe link once feedback loop lands.

## Decisions Needed
• Approve Sprint-10 scope: feedback ingestion + observability + release notes.  
• Decide on production deploy target (Droplet vs Fly.io) for launch.
