# Project Roadmap Milestones

This page summarises **when** meaningful value will be visible as the sprints progress.
It complements the detailed per-sprint plans found in `docs/Sprints/`.

| Milestone | Target Sprint | What You'll See |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Initial Deliverable** | **Sprint-04** | Geocoder utility active; listings now filtered to ≤ 1 mile radius. You can run the scheduler locally and inspect which listings pass/fail the distance test. |
| **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** | **Sprint-07** | End-to-end bot: scrapers fetch multi-site data; scheduler dedupes; scoring algorithm ranks listings; you receive scored results (CLI or log output). |
| **Feature-Complete v1.0** | **Sprint-10** | Automated notifications (email), feedback loop, observability dashboards, deployment guide. Ready for 24×7 operation until you sign a lease. |

> These targets assume each sprint's scope remains stable and passes CI on schedule. Delays in earlier sprints will naturally push milestones back.
