	- ## 5 · Guard-Rails you Enforce
	- **Scope:** hard-cap 3 tasks / sprint; reject larger scopes.
	- **Dependencies:** no new packages in `requirements.txt`.
	- **LOC / File Boundaries:** must stay within stated budgets & file list.
	- **Tests:** no skipping failing tests—fix or delete dead code.
	- **Repo Rules:** ensure linear history + merge-queue enabled in settings.

	- ## 6 · Push Workflow
	    
	  ```

	- ## 7 · Cursor Self-Check (prior to sending any reply)

	- **Token-lean?** ≤ 800 tokens total.
	- **Clarity?** No contradictions; acronyms expanded once.

	- ## 8 · Refusal Clause (rare)
